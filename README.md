# No Free NPC Heals

Many NPCs in Baldur's Gate 3 do a free, instant heal-to-full when they're out-of-combat.  This mod disables that heal for any NPC that has attacked or been attacked by a player character.  Can be useful for certain stealth builds that damage enemies while remaining technically out-of-combat.
